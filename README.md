# CS230 - Operating Platforms

## Project Three

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
For Project Three, we worked with our client "The Gaming Room", and we helped them to move their existing Android-based game "Draw It or Lose It" onto a web-based platform so that they could expand their player base. We also chose to go with a web-based solution so that the game could be played on multiple different operating systems, through the use of a web browser.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel I did fairly well on the "Domain Model" part of the documentation. I got a much deeper understanding of how to use UML diagrams to help diagram and implement software, and I feel I was able to clearly explain in about a paragraph what the UML diagram was trying to describe.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Again, the Domain Model portion, specifically the UML Diagram, was especially helpful in developing the code. When you can see all of the various elements of the code that will need to be implemented, there's no confusion about what needs to be done next, and the task of programming can be turned into somewhat of a checklist when compared against the given UML diagram.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The client's main request was that it was available on the 3 main operating systems, as well as mobile. The best way to achieve this is a relatively quick fasion was to implement the game in a web-based solution, where the game could be accessed through the browser. We chose this option since this functionality is already available to all of the operating systems, including mobile, so it would be farily easy using this method to make sure it was available on all of these OSs.
